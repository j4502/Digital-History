            <p class="read-more-wrap">The University of Missouri, like many college campuses, has often been a site of student unrest and protest. As a major university in a former slave state that had allied with the Union, it became a place where the forces of
              <span class="read-more-target"> integration and segregation clashed. Like many institutions of higher education, it also struggled between acting as an enforcer of social norms and as a space for social progress. Throughout the 20th century, students agitated against segregation, the Vietnam War, and homophobia. Whether this clash took place on the sidewalks or in the courtrooms, students stood up against the university in order to call for change. </span></p>

          <p class="read-more-wrap">Women’s history in Columbia, Mo, reflected many of the changes and trends they experienced and participated in, which were indicative of larger national changes in transportation, consumption,
            <span class="read-more-target">  and politics. This allowed for women to participate in society in new ways. In the context of the Progressive Era, we map the ways in which Midwestern women of Columbia, MO expanded their political power through consumption and grassroots activism networks.</span></p>

        <p class="read-more-wrap">Throughout the second half of the 19th century and especially around the turn of the 20th century, the Columbia hospitality industry went through a strong shift from small taverns to large hotels.
          <span class="read-more-target">The hotels built between 1879 and 1902 represented a growing transient population in Columbia from the universities and expansion of transportation into mid-Missouri. By 1917, Columbia was firmly a part of the modern hospitality industry. </span></p>
