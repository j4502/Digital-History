            <p class="read-more-wrap">The University of Missouri, like many college campuses, has often been a site of student unrest and protest. As a major university in a former slave state that had allied with the Union, it became a place where the forces of
              <span class="read-more-target">integration and segregation clashed. Like many institutions of higher education, it also struggled between acting as an enforcer of social norms and as a space for social progress. Throughout the 20th century, students agitated against segregation, the Vietnam War, and homophobia. Whether this clash took place on the sidewalks or in the courtrooms, students stood up against the university in order to call for change.</span></p>

           <p>Downtown Columbia is an area of approximately one square mile surrounded by the University of Missouri on the south, Stephens College to the east and Columbia College on the north. The area serves as Columbia's financial and business district and is the topic of a large initiative to draw tourism, which includes plans to capitalize on the area's historic architecture, and Bohemian characteristics.
