      <p> Over the past decade increased access to digital archives and exhibits has markedly altered the production and consumption of history.  The growing abundance of digitalized sources, geo-mapping software and videos offer historians the opportunity to ask different kinds of questions and employ new kinds of methods. The ease of building websites and creating on-line exhibits has moved history in to public spaces in new and exciting ways. Even a quick jaunt through cyberspace reveals a wealth of sites exploring aspects of the history of the slave trade, the Civil War, World War II, the holocaust, womenâ€™s rights, civil rights and transnational migration. Weaving together new kinds of evidence, new forms of presentation and new voices, these sites illustrate how new media and technologies are blurring the lines between academic and public history. Digital History at MU seeks to explore the possibilities inherent in digital media by showcasing student scholarship and faculty projects. </p>

            <a> <img src="assets/images/linda_reeder.jpeg" alt="Picture of Professor Linda Reeder"> </a>
           <p> Associate Professor
Ph.D., Rutgers University </p>

        <p>

Linda Reeder specializes in Italian women's history. Her research interests focus on gender, sexuality, transnational migration, national belonging and most recently, female insanity. Her first book, Widows in White: Migration and the Transformation of Rural Italian Women, published in 2003 by the University of Toronto Press, examines the role of Sicilian women in the process of transnational migration. In this work, she explores the role women who remained at home played in shaping migration networks and the impact emigration had on women's private and public lives. She has expanded her interest in mobility to examine the ways migration altered the meaning and practice of gender and sexuality in Italy between 1880 and 1922. Her work on gender and migration has led her to focus on the gendered nature of citizenship and national belonging. Her current book project, Disordered Houses examines the relationship between gender, sexuality and national belonging through notions of female insanity in late nineteenth century Italy. She is an affiliate faculty member of the Women's and Gender Studies Program at MU.

Professor Reeder teaches courses on 19th and 20th century European women's history, the history of modern Italy and contemporary Europe.
